## Create config file
Before build or run client, you must create a config file.
The config file is a text file with a data in a JSON format. Example below demonstrate witch data you must create.
```json
{
    "host": "1.2.3.4:8000",
    "showIp": true,

```

This command will create a config file with a default parameters.

### Config file parameters

- `host` defines host where client retrieves data
- `showIp` show or hide server's IP address on client
- `https` - if **true** connection will be over `htts/wss`
- `theme` - default `auto` (**dark/light** mode dependence from os), value can be `dark`, `light`

```json
{
    "blocks": [
        "hostname",
        "status",
        "blockheight",
        "uptime",
        "balance",
        "delegation",
        "rewards",
        "epoch",
        "ram-chart",
        "ram-usage",
        "cpu-usage",
        "cpu-load",
        "network",
        "peers",
        "addresses",
        "consensus"
    ]
}
```

## Run a client
You can run a client locally with a command:
```shell
npm start
```
